1. Initial state: Method that will set all the initial particles within a periodical box and assign -->
   their initial state.
   
2. Boundary conditions: Method to assign particle coordinates within periodical box. -->

3. Forces: Method that calculates the van der Waals forces at each particle -->

4. Integration: Method to integrate Newton’s equations -->

5. Statistics: Method to determine all averaged values of selected variables during simulation -->
trajectory and showing its final values at the end of the trajectory

6. Visualization of results: post-processing method that will deal with obtained data from a -->
given trajectory and will allow to show evolution of the different variables involved in the
molecular dynamics and other statistics at the highest level
